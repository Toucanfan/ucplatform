- Only constexpr constructors are allowed
- Real runtime constructor should be put in .init() function and called explicitly. (Then return error codes can be checked)
- If an object has no .init() function, it should be in a valid state when declared (e.g. constexpr-ctor and/or sane initializations of members)

- Use CamelCase for classes and camelCase for methods and functions.
- Errors are signalled by returning negative int's.

- Function inputs/outputs:
	- Inputs: Are passed by value or constant reference
	- Outputs: Are returned by value, cost-ref (if read-only/value semantics) or by writing to non-const pointer argument
	- In/outputs: Non-const pointer argument
